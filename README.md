## Experiment Background - Free Trial Screener

Students have a choice between enrolling in a free trial for the paid version or to access the course material for free (without coaching support or a verified certificate). With this experiment, Udacity tried to divert students to the free course material with a 'trial screener' if they did not input the minimum weekly commitment time to complete the course within the 14-days trial period.
